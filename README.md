Python Snake Game with Turtle

This repository contains a classic Snake game implementation using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that moves across the screen, grows longer with each piece of food it eats, and ends when it collides with itself or the screen border. The project demonstrates fundamental game development concepts such as collision detection, event handling, and game loop management using Turtle graphics.

Features:

    Snake Movement: Control the snake using the arrow keys.
    Food Consumption: Eat food to grow and score points.
    Collision Detection: Game ends if the snake hits the screen edges or itself.
    Simple Graphics: Basic graphics and animations using Turtle.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    Turtle module (included with standard Python distribution)

Installation:

    Clone the repository: git clone <repository_url>
    Navigate to the project directory: cd <project_directory>
    Run the game: python snake_game.py

Enjoy coding and playing the game!
